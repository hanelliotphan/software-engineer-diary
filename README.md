There will be times when bad products make your development productivity crushed into powder, 
and you would start to lose confidence and wonder if you are good enough. You are good enough, 
they are just bad products that harm your self-esteem. Good products are meant to assist you 
to become better, not drain you out. Detecting this at the early stage is already halfway to 
know your worth and boundaries.

Also, love yourself even at work, believe in yourself even at work. People with higher titles 
than yours do not mean they are better than you. Learn from their experience, but not necessarily 
listen and do what they tell you to do. Avoid being around with people who do micro-managing. 
You are much better, more capable and more beautiful than that.
